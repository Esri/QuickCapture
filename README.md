# About QuickCapture

![App](./thumbnail.png)

This mobile app is designed to help rapid data capture. It allows you to capture the location of assets or incidents as described in a predefined list of GIS feature types. You can use this app, for example, to capture the location of assets along a road while traveling in the passenger seat.

## How to use the app

Download the app from the [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.esri.quickcapture) or [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/quickcapture-for-arcgis/id1351959399) app stores.

The mobile app requires you to login. You can use the settings wheel button in the top-right corner of the OAuth dialog to define a connection to ArcGIS Enterprise. By default, the login dialog is hooked to Online.

After you login, the project gallery will display feature layers tagged as ```QuickCapture``` that have been shared with your account. It is assumed the logged-in user has read-write privileges on those feature layers.
